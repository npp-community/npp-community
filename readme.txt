Local development fork for Notepad++:
=====================================

Up-to-date with Notepad++ 5.4.3

On top of that:
- Added an option to enable / disable mouse wheel zooming
- Cleaned the PowerEditor source so it compiles with /W4 /WX
- Introduced precompiled headers
- Fixed the hotspot coloring bug
